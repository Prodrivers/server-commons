/**
 * Define the base Prodrivers Commons Section implementation. <i>Sections make plugins play nice together.</i>
 * <p>
 * A section is a logical subdivision of a server. A section can be a hub, a mini-game hub, a mini-game instance, or any
 * other needed subdivision. Sections are organized in a tree, with a root (default) section that is its point of entry.
 * Each section has event handlers to react to a player entering or leaving it, doing needed preparation and cleanup
 * work.
 * <p>
 * Its main use is to allow different plugins to play together by calling preparation and/or cleanup code when player
 * is moving between different subdivisions of the server without handling it themselves/having special code to handle
 * all cases, such as moving between a hub and a mini-game, or a mini-game to another mini-game. Prodrivers Commons'
 * role is to ensure that all join and leave event handlers are correctly called when moving along the section tree.
 * For example, it allows a player to move from one plugin's mini-game to another plugin's mini-game, on the same server
 * or across servers, with proper quit and join code called for each of them, without those plugins having to handle
 * themselves.
 * <p>
 * It ultimately allows plugins, that where not built to handle other plugins on a server or across servers in mind, to
 * implement those capabilities without many modifications, or even without any modifications by having another plugin
 * handle the interface for it.
 * <p>
 * Every new player enters the section mechanism by entering the root section. Each player, at any point in time, is
 * guaranteed to be part of a single section, as long as it is part of the mechanism.
 * <p>
 * Sections implementing it shall register themselves using {@link SectionManager#register(Section) SectionManager.register}
