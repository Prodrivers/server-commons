/**
 * Transitive Section
 * <p>
 * A transitive section is a section automatically created by Prodrivers Commons to fill holes in the section tree.
 * It is final and non-instantiable, as it is used internally only.
 * It does nothing on its own, designed to allow players to pass through to non-transitive sections, but has special
 * handling code to ensure that:
 * - players can not walk down the tree to a transitive section, i.e. a transitive section can not be the target node
 * when the player has to walk up and down the tree.
 * - players walking up the tree to a transitive section ends up walking to its parent until it encounters a
 * non-transitive section, i.e. a transitive section, when it is the target node and is attained only by walking up the
 * tree, acts a proxy for the non-transitive parent section.
